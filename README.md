The Vision Computing API is a powerful tool designed to bring computer vision capabilities into applications with ease. It provides endpoints for image classification, object detection, face recognition, and text extraction, helping developers integrate intelligent vision features without building models from scratch.

Features

Image Classification â€“ Categorize images into predefined classes.

Object Detection â€“ Identify and locate multiple objects within an image.

Face Detection & Recognition â€“ Detect and recognize human faces.

Text Extraction (OCR) â€“ Extract text from images with high accuracy.

Custom Model Support â€“ Deploy and use your own trained models.

Simple REST API â€“ Easy-to-use endpoints for quick integration.
